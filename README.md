# Circle Packing Image Processor

This project takes an input image and creates a **circle-packed representation** of it.

## Features
- Upload any image.
- Choose the **number of circles** (e.g., 100, 500, 1000).
- The circles are **packed based on image brightness** (darker areas get larger circles).
- Saves the final output as a **circle-packed image**.
